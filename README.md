# Feed Reader project from Udacity

This project is number 6 from Udacity's Frontend Nanodegree program. Feed Reader is a  web-based application that reads RSS feeds. 

## Scope and premise for the project
The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite.

### How to view
Either download the zip file and launch index.html or click [here](https://timjkstrickland.github.io/Feed-Reader) to see the test suite live. All of the tests are written in the **feedreader.js** file. Questions? Comments? Hit me up [timjk@timjkis.me](mailto:timjk@timjkis.me)
